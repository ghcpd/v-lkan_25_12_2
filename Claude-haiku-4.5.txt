keykaren: Prompt: 
Multi-Annotator Dataset Conflict Detection and Resolution
Task Description
You are given a dataset (tickets_label.jsonl) where each sample contains:

A text item
Multiple annotators’ labels
Possible disagreements among annotators
Your goal is to build a system that can:

Identify samples with label conflicts
A conflict exists when annotators assign different labels to the same text.
Extract and output all conflict samples
Save them into a new dataset structure that clearly lists annotators and their labels.
Analyze the causes of disagreement
Explain possible reasons why annotators provided different labels, such as:
Ambiguous text
Mixed sentiment or multiple aspects in the text
Unclear or inconsistent annotation guidelines
Suggest a final resolved label
Provide an automatic suggestion based on reasoning, not just majority vote
Include: majority label, confidence reasoning, and explanation
Input Format
Each sample in the input JSONL has the structure:

{"id": "<unique_id>","text": "<text>","annotations": [{"annotator": "A1", "intent": "...", "urgency": "..."},{"annotator": "A2", "intent": "...", "urgency": "..."},{"annotator": "A3", "intent": "...", "urgency": "..."}] } 
Output Format
For each sample, output a JSON object with the following fields:

{"id": "<id>","text": "<text>","labels": [{"annotator": "A1", "label": "..."},{"annotator": "A2", "label": "..."},{"annotator": "A3", "label": "..."}],"is_conflict": true/false,"conflict_reason": "<reason or null>","suggested_label": "<final_label>" } 
Requirements

Accuracy in identifying conflicts among annotators
Quality of reasoning describing the cause of disagreements
Reliability of suggested final label
Reproducible environment setup, e.g., requirements.txt, Dockerfile, setup.sh
Automated test code to verify:
Correct detection of conflicts
Accurate extraction of conflict samples
Reliability of suggested final labels
Correct reasoning and explanation for disagreements
Handling datasets with multiple documents or batches
Ability to output detailed test report templates for easy analysis of results
Evaluation Goals

Correctness & Fidelity: Detect conflicts correctly and suggest reasonable labels
Completeness: Analyze causes of disagreement thoroughly
Smoothness & Developer Experience: Code should be maintainable, testable, and reproducible
Documentation & Clarity: Output explanations should be clear and structured

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you build a comprehensive system for multi-annotator dataset conflict detection and resolution. Let me start by examining the input dataset and then create a complete solution.

Perfect! I can see the dataset contains ticket annotations with `intent` and `urgency` labels. I can see there are some conflicts (e.g., TICK-0026, TICK-0027, TICK-0028, etc.). Now I'll create a comprehensive solution with conflict detection, analysis, and resolution.

Now let me run the analysis and tests to validate the system: 

Ran terminal command: cd d:\Downloads\1\Claude-haiku-4.5\v-lkan_25_12_2 ; python -m pip install -q -r requirements.txt 2>&1 | findstr /V "already"

Let me try with python3: 

Ran terminal command: python3 --version

Let me check what Python executables are available: 

Ran terminal command: where python

GitHub Copilot: I'll use the Python executable you provided to create a virtual environment and run the analysis. Let me set it up: 

Ran terminal command: "D:\package\venv310\Scripts\python.exe" -m venv venv_conflict

Let me use cmd instead: 

Ran terminal command: cd /d d:\Downloads\1\Claude-haiku-4.5\v-lkan_25_12_2 & "D:\package\venv310\Scripts\python.exe" -m venv venv_conflict

Let me switch to cmd.exe terminal mode by creating a batch file:

Now let me run the batch file: 

Ran terminal command: cmd /c run_full_analysis.bat
